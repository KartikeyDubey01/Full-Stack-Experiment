# Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Theme Switching

## ðŸ§  Aim

Design and build a professional, responsive admin dashboard interface using **HTML**, **CSS Grid**, and a theme switching feature (light and dark modes). This practical focuses on advanced layout skills and creating adaptable UI through theming without page reloads.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Learn to structure complex layouts using CSS Grid.
- Implement a responsive dashboard with header, sidebar, main content, and footer areas.
- Add a client-side theme switch (light/dark) that updates styles instantly.
- Practice clean, semantic HTML and maintainable CSS patterns.

## ðŸ“‹ Task Description

Create a web page that contains the following sections:

- **Header**: Dashboard title and a theme switch control (light/dark).
- **Sidebar**: Navigation links such as Home, Users, and Settings.
- **Main Content Area**: Placeholder for charts, tables, or welcome messages.
- **Footer**: Footer text or copyright.

Requirements:

- Use **CSS Grid** to arrange the page layout in a professional manner.
- The theme switch should toggle between light and dark modes without reloading the page.
- The layout must be responsive and adapt to smaller screens (mobile/tablet).

## ðŸªœ Steps Followed

1. Built the HTML structure with semantic elements: `<header>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
2. Applied CSS Grid on the `<body>` to create named grid areas for precise placement.
3. Implemented responsive behavior using a media query for narrow viewports.
4. Added a simple theme switch using a checkbox and toggling a CSS class (`.dark-mode`) on the `<body>` via JavaScript.
5. Tested the UI in desktop and mobile screen widths to ensure proper responsiveness and contrast in both themes.

## ðŸ§¾ Code

> The dashboard is implemented in a single HTML file (`index.html`) that contains inline CSS and JavaScript for simplicity. You can split CSS and JS into separate files if preferred.
